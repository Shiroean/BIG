        <h1>Functions and Uses of Binance</h1>
        <p><strong>Cryptocurrency Trading:</strong> Binance is primarily known for its cryptocurrency trading platform. Users can trade a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many altcoins. The platform offers various trading pairs, advanced trading features, and competitive fees.</p>
        <p><strong>Binance Coin (BNB):</strong> Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem. BNB is used to pay for trading fees on the platform at a discounted rate, participate in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and more. It started as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but has since migrated to Binance Chain.</p>
        <p><strong>Binance Smart Chain (BSC):</strong> Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain that runs parallel to Binance Chain and supports smart contracts. It allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects with lower fees and faster transaction times compared to Ethereum.</p>
        <p><strong>Binance Launchpad:</strong> Binance Launchpad is a platform for launching new cryptocurrency projects through Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs). It helps projects raise funds and gain visibility while providing Binance users with early access to new tokens.</p>
        <p><strong>Binance Academy:</strong> Binance Academy is an educational platform that offers free resources, articles, and tutorials on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency trading, and other related topics. It aims to help users learn and understand the crypto space.</p>
        <p><strong>Binance NFT Marketplace:</strong> Binance has also entered the NFT space with its NFT marketplace. Users can buy, sell, and trade non-fungible tokens representing unique digital assets like artwork, music, and virtual items.</p>
